# Regression_Model_Delivery_prj2
Linear_Regression_Practical_Delivery Objective : Build a simple linear regression model by performing EDA and do necessary transformations and select the best model using Python. data set shared was -Delivery Time.
Solution : a> Data Pre-processing Steps. b> Fitting the MLR model to the training set. c> Predicting the result of the test set.
Result : The r2 score tells that our model is 82% accurate with the training dataset.
